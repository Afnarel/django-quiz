Django quiz app
===============

This is a configurable quiz app for Django.

I use it to run a few medical revision websites. Here is an [example website](http://www.revisemrcp.com/)

My websites have used twitter bootstrap for the front end and I have tried to strip out anything from 
the template files that are dependant on bootstrap.

This is a major work in progress.

Current features
----------------
Features of each quiz:
* Question order randomisation
* Storing of quiz results under each user
* Previous quiz scores can be viewed on category page
* Correct answers can be shown after each question or all at once at the end
* Logged in users can return to an incomplete quiz to finish it

Multiple choice questions
* Questions can be given a category
* Success rate for each category can be monitored on a progress page
* Explanation for each question result can be given


It was developed using Django 1.4.1. 

This is my first open source project so please forgive any problems and/or dreadful code!
